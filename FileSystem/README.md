# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
This series of .java files is designed to allow the user to create, write to, and read from a .txt file.  I used a base found on w3schools for the reading and writing, and added in and changed multiple lines to allow the user to input what they wanted instead of pre-determined information.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I decided to write this program because I have little experience when it comes to programs reading and writing to other files.  I know this ability is extremely important in any programming field, so I wanted to increase my knowledge on the subject.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
